                <div class="content-text">
                    In this demo I will attempt to explain what Google Analytics (GA) & Google Tag Manager (GTM) are, what they are used for and what the relationship
                    between these two packages are.
                    I will also show you how to set up a GA account, how to connect GTM to your GA account and how to track basic information across your site.

                <h2>What is Google Analytics (GA) ?</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    GA is a service that can track and report website traffic information.
                    <p>
                        We use GA to gather information and report on how our users interact with our sites so that we can identify poorly
                        performing pages with techniques such as funnel visualization, where visitors came from (referrers),
                        how long they stayed and their geographical position.
                        It also provides more advanced features, including custom visitor segmentation.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>What is Google Tag Manager (GTM) ?</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    GTM is a system created to manage JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics on sites.
                    <p>
                        Tags are bits of code (sometimes referred to as a pixels or beacons) that let us measure traffic and visitor behavior,
                        GTM allows product managers & other non-devs to create and manage tags via a user interface rather than manual
                        insertion and management in the source code.

                <h2>Setting Up Google Analytics</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    For us to track activity on our site we must first have a GA account linked up to our actual website.<br>
                    This will give us a GA account ID (aka a property) that will allow us to link our tracking code to our GA account for our given website.
                    <p>
                        To set up a GA account and a container you can follow <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en" target="_blank">these steps</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Note: A single GA account can hold multiple  properties, each with their own unique ID, allowing us to track multiple sites from the same GA account.
                        </strong>
                    </p>

            <div class="content-block">

                <h2>Set up event tracking... enter GTM</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    Now that we have our GA account and our property ID we are almost ready to get started with page tracking.<br>
                    First however we must add code to our site that will allow GA to track these events.
                    <p>
                        There are two ways to collect page tracking data:

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h3>
                                    Add the GA tracking code directly into the HTML of every page of your website.
                                </h3>
								
								<p>
									<div class="code-snippet">
									<pre><code>
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');
									</code></pre>
									</div>
								</p>
								<p>
									The above code snippet can be found in GA via: <br> 
									Admin > Account (whatever account you wish to track) > Property (whichever property you wish to track) > Tracking Info > Tracking Code.
								</p>
                                <p>
                                    This is the easiest approach (not the best) if you only want to add the basic GA tracking code to your site.<br>
                                    With this snippet you send a pageview for each page your users visits.<br>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    GA then processes this data and can infer a great deal of information including:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The total time a user spends on your site.</li>
                                        <li>The time a user spends on each page and in what order those pages were visited.</li>
                                        <li>What internal links were clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>
                                    In addition, the IP address, user agent string, and initial page inspection analytics.js
                                    does when creating a new tracker is used to determine things like the following:<br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The geographic location of the user.</li>
                                        <li>What browser and operating system are being used.</li>
                                        <li>Screen size and whether Flash or Java is installed.</li>
                                        <li>The referring site.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                            </li>


                            <li>
                                <h3>
                                    Add the Google Analytics tag (Universal Analytics) using Google Tag Manager
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    This step requires having a GTM account.<br>
                                    Go to <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com" target="_blank"> tagmanager.google.com </a> to create a Google Tag Manager account (or to access an existing account).
                                </p>
								<p>
									Once you have a GTM account then you can copy the GTM code snippet (see below) into your site code referencing the GTM container ID (GTM-XXXXXX).<br>
									This allows GTM to run on this site now which can then give you the ability to load GA via the GTM Interface.
									<div class="code-snippet">
<pre><code>
(function (w, d, s, l, i) {
	w[l] = w[l] || []; w[l].push({
	'gtm.start':
	new Date().getTime(), event: 'gtm.js'
	});
	var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
		j = d.createElement(s),
		dl = l != 'dataLayer' ? '&l=' + l : '';
		j.async = true;
		j.src ='//www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=' + i + dl;
		f.parentNode.insertBefore(j, f);
	})(window, document, 'script', 'dataLayer', 'GTM-XXXXXX');
	
</code></pre>
									</div>

                                <p>
                                    See <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107124?rd=1" target="_blank"> here </a> for a detailed breakdown of what to do.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This approach is recommended because using Google Tag Manager simplifies tag management on your site.<br>
                                    Using Google Tag Manager makes it easier to add other tags (such as AdWords Conversion Tracking and remarketing tags) to your site and configure your Google Analytics tracking.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To do this, add the Google Analytics tag (Universal Analytics, not classic) to your container in <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com" target="_blank">Google Tag Manager</a> and publish the container (Red button top right).
                                </p>

                <h2>Make sure you're collecting data</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
				
					There are a few ways you can check to see if the GA tracking code on your website is working.

					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>Check your Real-Time reports</h3>
							<p>
								With the Real-Time reports, you can monitor user activity as it happens. If you see data in these reports, it means that your tracking code is currently collecting data.

								<ul>
									<li>Sign in to your GA account.</li>
									<li>Navigate to a view in the property to which you added the tracking code. If you only recently added the tracking code to this property (website), it is likely that there will only be one view.</li>
									<li>Select the Reporting tab.</li>
									<li>Select Real-Time > Overview.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>Use Google Tag Assistant</h3>
							<p>
								<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-by-google/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk/?utm_source=google.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gtar_diag_notification" target="_blank" >
									Google Tag Assistant</a> is a free Chrome browser extension that shows you if GA tags are firing correctly. <br>
									Using Google Tag Assistant, you can record user flows on your website and then view a report of all the hits sent during that flow, as well as how GA interprets them.<br>
									This tool is quite comprehensive and can give valuable insights, a walkthrough on this tool can be found <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6280771" target="_blank">here</a>.

							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h3>GA Debug</h3>
							<p>
								This is another free browser extension that prints useful information to the JavaScript console by enabling the debug version of the Google Analytics Javascript.<br>
								The chrome extension and more information on it can be found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en" target="_blank"> here </a>.

                <h2>Next up... Custom Dimensions</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                  Now that we have GA & GTM set up we have the ability to track events.<br>
				  Sometimes however we wish to track more than just basic events, this is where <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828?hl=en" target="_blank">Custom Dimensions</a> come in.
				  
				  <h3> What are Custom Dimensions? </h3>
				  <p>
				  	Custom dimensions are a way for you to track extra things that are not been tracked in GA by default.<br>
					And as the name implies; they’re custom. This means that you can specify what you want GA to track.<br>
					We can use custom dimensions to track user state, authors of pages, levels in games, or any other data you have on a page.<br>
					<p>
						Examples of custom dimensions in gardenersworld.com include:
						<ol>
							<li>Article Template Name</li>
							<li>PublishDate</li>
							<li>Member Status</li>
							<li>Channel</li>
							<li>Module</li>
							<li>Object</li>
							<li>MemberId</li>
							<li>ClientID</li>
							<li>Krux ID</li>
						</ol>
						<a href="http://www.amazeemetrics.com/sites/default/files/Google%20Analytics%20vs%20Universal%20Analytics.png" target="blank">UA vs GAC</a>
					</p>
					
					<h3>Lifecycle of a Custom Dimension</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> – you define your custom dimensions in GA.
							</li>
							<li>
								Collection – you send custom dimension values to GA.
							</li>
							<li>
								Processing – your data is processed using your custom dimension definitions and any reporting view filters inside GA.
							</li>
							<li>
								Reporting – you build new reports using your custom dimensions GA user interface.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<h3 id="configuration"> Setting up Custom Dimensions - Configuration</h3>
					<p>
						Custom Dimensions must be defined in GA.<br>
						This can be done by going to the correct property for the GA account you have, for us this is; <br>
						Account = Gardeners World > Property = UAT Gardeners World > Custom Definitions > Custom Dimensions. <br>
						From here we now have the ability to add a new custom dimension.<br>
						<p>
						When we create a new custom dimension we are given three options:
							<ol>
								<li>Name</li>
								<li>Scope</li>
								<li>Active state</li>
							</ol>
						
						At this point is is important to note that for the non-premium GA there are a <strong>maximum of 20 custom dimensions per property</strong> (200 in GA Premium).<br>
						Also note that once a custom dimension has been created it <strong>cannot be deleted</strong>, so create them with care.
						</p>
						The index of the new custom dimension is also worth noting as when you are debugging GA to test that your dimensions are being set you will see them displayed as 'dimensionX' (X = index of custom dimension).<br>
						<p>
							Example:<br>
							<div class="code-snippet"><code>ga("gtm1453460425693.set", "<strong>dimension2</strong>", "01-01-0001")</code></div><br>
							Of the three parameters we are presented with when creating a custom dimension two of them are self explanatory, Name & Active state, but there is some mystery around what the'Scope' of a custom dimension is.
						</p>
					</p>
					
					<h3>What is the 'Scope' of a Custom Dimensions?</h3>
					<p>
						The scope attribute determines which hits will be associated with a custom dimension value.<br>
						There are four levels of scope: <strong>product, hit, session, </strong> and <strong>user</strong>:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Product -</strong> This binds the custom dimension to the <strong>Enhanced Ecommerce event</strong> and the product its sent with.<br>
								This means that it only exists in that single event (think - 'add to cart', 'checkout' , 'purchase' ) and not through the entire Enhanced Ecommerce funnel.<br>
								More info <a href="http://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/product-scoped-custom-dimensions-and-metrics/" target="_blank">here</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Hit -</strong> This means the value is applied to the single hit for which it has been set. (think - setting memberState on log-out button click event)<br>
								More info on what a Hit is <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6086082?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Session -</strong> When a custom dimension is set with session scope it means that the most recent value being applied to that custom dimension
								will persist across all hit values for that session, even overriding previous hits that would have set the custom dimension to a different value.
								More info <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828?hl=en#processing" target="_blank">here</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>User -</strong> 
								User scope means that if a custom dimension is set to a value during a single session, this value - unless changed - will persist into the next session for that user.
							</li>
						</ul>
