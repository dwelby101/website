                <div class="content-text">
                    In this demo I will attempt to explain what Google Analytics (GA) & Google Tag Manager (GTM) are, what they are used for and what the relationship
                    between these two packages are.
                    I will also show you how to set up a GA account, how to connect GTM to your GA account and how to track basic information across your site.

                <h2>What is Google Analytics (GA) ?</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    GA is a service that can track and report website traffic information.
                    <p>
                        We use GA to gather information and report on how our users interact with our sites so that we can identify poorly
                        performing pages with techniques such as funnel visualization, where visitors came from (referrers),
                        how long they stayed and their geographical position.
                        It also provides more advanced features, including custom visitor segmentation.

            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>What is Google Tag Manager (GTM) ?</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    GTM is a system created to manage JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics on sites.
                    <p>
                        Tags are bits of code (sometimes referred to as a pixels or beacons) that let us measure traffic and visitor behavior,
                        GTM allows product managers & other non-devs to create and manage tags via a user interface rather than manual
                        insertion and management in the source code.

                <h2>Setting Up Google Analytics</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    For us to track activity on our site we must first have a GA account linked up to our actual website.<br>
                    This will give us a GA account ID (aka a container / property) that will allow us to link our tracking code to our GA account for our given website.
                    <p>
                        To set up a GA account and a container you can follow <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en" target="_blank">these steps</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            Note: A single GA account can hold multiple containers / properties, each with their own unique ID, allowing us to track multiple sites from the same GA account.
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">

                <h2>Set up event tracking... enter GTM</h2>

                <div class="content-text">
                    Now that we have our GA account and our container / property ID we are almost ready to get started with page tracking.<br>
                    First however we must add code to our site that will allow GA to track these events.
                    <p>
                        There are two ways to collect page tracking data:

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h3>
                                    Add the tracking code directly into the HTML of every page of your website.
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    This is the easiest approach (not the best) if you only want to add the basic GA tracking code to your site.<br>
                                    With this snippet you send a pageview for each page your users visits.<br>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    GA then processes this data and can infer a great deal of information including:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The total time a user spends on your site.</li>
                                        <li>The time a user spends on each page and in what order those pages were visited.</li>
                                        <li>What internal links were clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>
                                    In addition, the IP address, user agent string, and initial page inspection analytics.js
                                    does when creating a new tracker is used to determine things like the following:<br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The geographic location of the user.</li>
                                        <li>What browser and operating system are being used.</li>
                                        <li>Screen size and whether Flash or Java is installed.</li>
                                        <li>The referring site.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                            </li>


                            <li>
                                <h3>
                                    Add the Google Analytics tag (Universal Analytics) using Google Tag Manager
                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    This step requires having a GTM account.<br>
                                    Go to <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com" target="_blank"> tagmanager.google.com </a> to create a Google Tag Manager account (or to access an existing account).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    See <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107124?rd=1" target="_blank"> here </a> for a detailed breakdown of what to do.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This approach is recommended because using Google Tag Manager simplifies tag management on your site.<br>
                                    Using Google Tag Manager makes it easier to add other tags (such as AdWords Conversion Tracking and remarketing tags) to your site and configure your Google Analytics tracking.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To do this, add the Google Analytics tag (Universal Analytics, not classic) to your container in <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com" target="_blank">Google Tag Manager</a> and publish the container (Red button top right).
                                </p>
                            </li>

                <div class="content-text">
                There are a few ways you can check to see if the GA tracking code on your website is working.
                </div>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Check your Real-Time reports</h3>
                        <p>
                            With the Real-Time reports, you can monitor user activity as it happens. If you see data in these reports, it means that your tracking code is currently collecting data.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Sign in to your GA account.</li>
                                <li>Navigate to a view in the property to which you added the tracking code. If you only recently added the tracking code to this property (website), it is likely that there will only be one view.</li>
                                <li>Select the Reporting tab.</li>
                                <li>Select Real-Time > Overview.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Use Google Tag Assistant</h3>

                                Google Tag Assistant</a> is a free Chrome browser extension that shows you if GA tags are firing correctly. <br>
                                Using Google Tag Assistant, you can record user flows on your website and then view a report of all the hits sent during that flow, as well as how GA interprets them.<br>
